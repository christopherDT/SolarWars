Solar Wars is a simple supply and demand game. You travel from planet to planet, 
buying and selling goods. Each planet specializes in certain goods and lacks 
certain resources, which influences prices. You start with a certain amount of 
money, and the goal is to get as much as possible before the timer runs out. 
Every time you warp to a new planet costs a day of travel time. Random events 
also happen (e.g. getting boarded by space pirates), which will affect your 
money or items. There's also a bank and a loan shark you can borrow money from.
